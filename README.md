Description: This repository contains data and code to generate an RShiny app to describe the study design and interactive heatmaps of Adjusted hazard ratios (aHR) calculated via Cox regression models. The data management scripts incorporate the aHR data tables to create heatmaps for each set of results. The app.R file is the master file that is used to build and design the interactive features of the webpage, incorporating the data management scripts to include tables and figures on the webpage.
